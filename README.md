# TalOS - Reborn
## What is this application?

TalOS: Reborn is a rewritten, reimagined version of the original TalOS project. The TalOS: Reborn project aims to bring a new, fresh, and modern experience to the TalOS project, while still keeping the same core values and features that made the original TalOS project so great. The goal is to make the creation, management, usage, and sharing of AI-based features and tools like LLMs, ChatBots, Stable Diffusion art, and more, as easy and accessible as possible.

## What is TalOS?

TalOS, now called TalOS reborn, is a desktop application with external web services that allows users to create, manage, and use AI-based features and tools like LLMs, ChatBots, Stable Diffusion art, and more from an easily setup and accessible desktop application. With TalOS: Reborn, it's also accessible from a web browser or a mobile device.
